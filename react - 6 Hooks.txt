					HOOKS	




=========================================================================================================================================

Hooks are functions introduced into React V-16.8, that allow you to hook into React state and lifestyle features of components.





STATE	------	a components internal data that determines behavior, used to store data that affects that component

STATELESS  --	a component that does not reference any variable.... everything is hard coded. 
		Holds no state, inheritence of state through props.

STATEFULL  --	a component that references a variable to render.  Holds state as internal data... changes due to actions


Since the child component stores no state, it is therefore a stateless component. All of it data comes from props.
The App component store the state which can be change through events and fucntions.

You also observed that although a stateless component can't directly pass state, 
it can still trigger actions that will update the state of other components.

Stateful components have both props and state. They're in charge of 
		client server, communication, processing data 
and responding to user events. These sorts of logistics should be encapsulated in a moderate number of statefull components.

 all visualization and formatting logic should move downstream into as many stateless components as possible




						USESTATE
					==========================

This hook is used to manage the state within a component and keep track of it and it's built directly into React.
So it's functionality is a library that must be imported for use. Similar to how you import that DOM-client,.....



		importReact, { useState } from 'React';


Next it is nessessary to declare a state variable to which data is stored for use/manipulation. Any name can be used, 
but there is a little quirk to remember so that you will fit in. The setter functionality of this hook is best used 
through a process called array destructuring. It returns a pair which is an array with two items.... it's at this point 
that you simplify the variable call to the array object, not needing to call [index]... I think (presumed knowledge).


		const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)

		const [showMenu, setShowMenu] = useState(false)


	-It creates a state variable with an initial value that represents the current state..... showMenu

	-And it creates a function to set that states variable value... setShowMenu

The use case hook should be called at the top level of your components.... so the ENTIRE component has 
access to the INFO.

  ); 															H
} 															H

To do this, let's define a React component and call it InputComponent. This component renders three things:		H
															H
	-An input text field 												H	
	-Any text that has been entered into the field 									H
	-A Reset button to set the field back to its default state 							H
															H	
As the user starts typing within the text field, the current text that was typed is also displayed.			H
															H
	H===============================H										H
	H	Welcome			H										H
	H===============================H										H	
															H
	You typed: Welcome												H
															H
	H===========H													H
	H  RESET    H		<--clicking the reset button will update the inputText back to “hello”. 		H
	H===========H													H
															H
															H
The state variable inputText and the setText method are used to set the current text that is typed. 			H
The useState hook is initialized at the beginning of the component.							H
															H
	const[inputText, setText] = useState('hello'); <---HELLO is the initial value					H
															H
========================================================================================================================H


Keep in mind that the inputText here is local state and is local to the InputComponent. This means that outside of this 
component, inputText is unavailable and unknown. In React, state is always referred to the local state of a component.



Hooks also come with a set of rules, that you need to follow while using them. This applies to all React hooks, 
including the useState hook that you just learned.

	-You can only call hooks at the top level of your component or your own hooks. 
	-You cannot call hooks inside loops or conditions. 
	-You can only call hooks from React functions, and not regular JavaScript functions. 
	-one can't use the state's setting variable from your state directly. 
		Instead of updating it directly, I can update it based on a click event.... or change event
	 	Because of the way React looks for changes to re-render the DOM

					useRef hook
					-----------



=================================================================================================================================================================

		We use the useRef hook to access a child element directly.

When you invoke the useRef hook, it will return a ref object. The ref object has a property named current.

-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-
function TextInputWithFocusButton() {
  const inputEl = useRef(null);
  const onButtonClick = () => {
    inputEl.current.focus();		<-- `current` points to the mounted text input element
  };
  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputEl} type="text" />
      <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Focus the input</button>
    </>
  );
}
-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	

Using the ref attribute on the input element, I can then access the current value and 
invoke the focus() method on it, thereby focusing the input field.

There are situations where accessing the DOM directly is needed, and this is where the useRef hook comes into play.

					STATE MANAGEMENT




=================================================================================================================================

How to share state through multiple layers of components within more complex apps.

Perform basic states management using the useContext and a useReducer hooks found in context API. 



API  ---------------	application programming interface. Predefines set of way to interact with code.

CONTEXT API   ------	can be used to  manage state more efficiently across multiple levels of components.
			makes it able to share props without drilling through children....
					~~SAVE THE BABIES!!!~~

PROVIDER   ---------	component that STORE the state

CONSUMER   ---------	component that will USE the state





					


				CREATE/USE CONTEXT
				------------------
In a nut shell You save state in a global component named UserContextProvider... The provider wrapps
the app component so it can basically send its state down as a prop.... i think


Import createContext, useContext, useState.  All examples so far show the trio being used in tandem.
a naming convention similar to useState is used when assigning createContext a name.

	const UserContext = createContext(undefined); <-- undefined when the initial state is unknown

A Provider JSX function is declared under the same naming convention.... UserProvider in this case.
In the provider function, state is declared with some value.... usually a fetch call, and the return 
of this function is a JSX component that basically links the UserContext to a provider method. Use of 
this function is needed elsewhere.... so export this fucker!!!

	~~return <UserContext.Provider value={{ user }}></UserContext.Provider>;

The value is the state data being sent as a prop. * I think *

A custom hook is also exported as a means for other components to CONSUME this context value.
This external function is created just for convenience, so there's no need to export the user context to external componets.

	export const useUser = () => useContext(UserContext);

Looks like this const IS the prop. Destructure the hook where ever it's consumption is needed.

			const {user} =userUser();

					React.memo	/	usememo
				---------------------------------------------
		============================================================================
				How re-rendering works with Context

In this reading you will learn about the default behavior of React rendering and when context is used. 
You will discover how to prevent unnecessary top-level re-renders with React.memo and how object references 
work in JavaScript. You will also learn how to utilize the useMemo hook to guarantee object references don’t 
change during re-rendering.

So far, you have learned that when a component consumes some context value and the value of this context changes, that component re-renders.

But what happens with all components in between? Is React wise enough to only re-render the consumers and 
bypass the intermediary components in the tree? Well, as it turns out, that doesn’t always happen and extra 
care should be taken when designing your React Context.

When it comes to the default behavior of React rendering, if a component renders, React will recursively 
re-render all its children regardless of props or context. Let’s illustrate this point with an example that uses some context.

Imagine the following component structure, where the top level component injects a Context provider at the top: 

	App (ContextProvider) > A > B > C
-	-	-	-	-	-
	const App = () => {
	return (
	   <AppContext.Provider>
	     <ComponentA />
	   </AppContext.Provider>
	 );
	};
	
	const ComponentA = () => <ComponentB />;
	const ComponentB = () => <ComponentC />;
	const ComponentC = () => null;
-	-	-	-	-	-

If the outermost App component re-renders for whatever reason, all ComponentA, ComponentB and ComponentC 
components will re-render as well, following this order: 

	App (ContextProvider) -> A -> B -> C

If some of your top level components are complex in nature, this could result in some performance hit. 
To mitigate this issue, you can make use of the top level API React.memo().

If your component renders the same result given the same props, you can wrap it in a call to 
React.memo for a performance boost by memoizing the result.

Memoization is a programming technique that accelerates performance by caching the return values of expensive function calls.

This means that React will skip rendering the component, and reuse the last rendered result. 
This is a trivial case for ComponentA, since it doesn’t receive any props.

		const ComponentA = React.memo(() => <ComponentB />);

	---React.memo takes the component definition as a first argument. 
	---An optional second argument can be included if you would like to specify some custom 
	logic that defines when the component should re-render based on previous and current props.

After that little adjustment, you will prevent any rendering from happening in all ComponentA, ComponentB and ComponentC if the App component re-renders.

-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-
	const App = () => {
	return (
	   <AppContext.Provider>
	     <ComponentA />
	   </AppContext.Provider>
	 );
	};

	const ComponentA = React.memo(() => <ComponentB />);
	const ComponentB = () => <ComponentC />;
	const ComponentC = () => null;
-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-

	***A good rule of thumb is to wrap the React component right 
		after your context provider with React.memo.****

In real-life applications, you will find yourself in need of passing several pieces of data as context value, 
rather than a single primitive like a string or number, so you’ll be working most likely with JavaScript objects.

Now, according to React context rules, all consumers that are descendants of a provider will 
re-render whenever the provider’s value prop changes.

Let’s go through the following scenario built upon the previous example, where the 
context value that gets injected is defined as an object called value with two properties, 
‘a’ and ‘b’, being both strings. Also, ComponentC is now a consumer of context, so any time 
the provider value prop changes, ComponentC will re-render.

-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-
	const App = () => {
	  const value = {a: 'hi', b: 'bye'};
	  return (
	    <AppContext.Provider value={value}>
	      <ComponentA />
	    </AppContext.Provider>
	  );
	};

	const ComponentA = React.memo(() => <ComponentB />);
	const ComponentB = () => <ComponentC />;
	const ComponentC = () => {
	  const contextValue = useContext(AppContext);
	  return null;
	};
-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-

Imagine that the value prop from the provider changes to {a: ‘hello’, b: ‘bye’}.

If that happens, the sequence of re-renders would be:

	App (ContextProvider) -> C

That’s all fine and expected, but what would happen if the App component re-renders 
for any other reason and the provider value doesn’t change at all, being still {a: ‘hi’, b: ‘bye’}? 

It may be a surprise to you to find out that the sequence of re-renders is the same as before:

	App (ContextProvider) -> C

Even though the provider value doesn’t seem to change, ComponentC gets re-rendered.

To understand what’s happening, you need to remember that in JavaScript, the below assertion is true:

	***	{a: ‘hi’, b: ‘bye’} !== {a: ‘hi’, b: ‘bye’}	***

That is because object comparison in JavaScript is done by reference. 
Every time a new re-render happens in the App component, a new instance of the value object is created, 
resulting in the provider performing a comparison against its previous value and determining that 
it has changed, hence informing all context consumers that they should re-render.

This problem can be resolved by using the useMemo hook from React as follows. 


-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-
	const App = () => {
	  const a = 'hi';
	  const b = 'bye';
	  const value = useMemo(() => ({a, b}), [a, b]);

	  return (
	    <AppContext.Provider value={value}>
	      <ComponentA />
	    </AppContext.Provider>
	  );
	};

	const ComponentA = React.memo(() => <ComponentB />);
	const ComponentB = () => <ComponentC />;
	const ComponentC = () => {
	  const contextValue = useContext(AppContext);
	  return null;
	};
-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-

Hooks will be covered in depth in the next module, so don’t worry too much if this is new for you.

For the purpose of this example, it suffices to say that useMemo will memoize the returned value 
from the function passed as the first argument and will only re-run the computation if any of the 
values are passed into the array as a second argument change.

With that implementation, if the App re-renders for any other reason that does not change 
any of ‘a’ or ‘b’ values, the sequence of re-renders will be as such:

	App (ContextProvider)

This is the desired result, avoiding an unnecessary re-render on ComponentC. 
useMemo guarantees keeping the same object reference for the value variable and since 
that’s assigned to the provider’s value, it determines that the context has not changed 
and should not notify any consumer.

	if (action.type === 'fuel') return {money: state.money - 50};
	return new Error();
}

export default App() {

	const initialState = {money: 100};			<-- THE object literal... ends up... state.money.... THAT HOW TO ACCESS OBJECTS (KEY: VALUE) pairs
	const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);	<-- use dispatch method of reducer hook...accepts object literal
