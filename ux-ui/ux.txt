======================================================================================================================

UX means user experience. It includes everything related to all the interactions that a user 
has with a company, its services and products, recognize that UX is a process with several stages.

			UX is about all of this?
Don norman, one of the most famous researchers in the field of design, coined the term U X.
He was concerned with the experience customers were having with the product. How could users 
find the product in store, how could they get at home? What was it like opening the box, 
how easy where the assembly instructions? What did it feel like to use, was it intuitive and enjoyable, 


			These are problems UX can solve
Have you ever used an appliance and you didn't know whether it was on or off, 
or use an app where you had a hard time getting what you wanted. A product's features need to be 
discoverable so you know what you are looking for. Successful product design also needs to 
converse with you, it needs to give you feedback on your actions.

Considering and designing for the user and not what you think the user wants are key to successful UX.

The process is iterative, you may have to go back to previous steps to adjust your 
design to suit the customers and business goals several times. 

	If you are designing something, 
you observe people doing the task. And from that you can 
identify problems that they may have completing that task. You then may have some 
ideas to work on. Then you 
prototype your intended solution and 
test it.
